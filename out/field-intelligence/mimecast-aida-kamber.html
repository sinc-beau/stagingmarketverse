She describes the familiar debates. &quot;Is it linear? Is it uniform? Is it last touch? Is it first touch? All the attribution models that we know if you look at any of them just one way you&#x27;re limiting yourself. Depends on what question you&#x27;re asking, right?&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">Her team uses HockeyStack, which recently added an AI-driven model that can weigh things differently. &quot;We know that digital is going to have more touch points and be more volume driven, but this one event really had a big impact, right? And so we&#x27;re going to weigh those things differently within the attribution model just to kind of tell you truly what&#x27;s bringing the lift in pipeline and you&#x27;re not getting lost in the noise.&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">Because here&#x27;s the problem with equal weighting: &quot;When we try to look at it all as equal, digital always looks better. And I should say as a digital marketer, yay. But I know that&#x27;s not the case. I know events are important.&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">So her team is trying to have &quot;a more balanced view of what does that journey truly look like?&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">And they love building those journeys when a deal closes. &quot;We started here with this ad. They clicked on it. They downloaded this piece of content and they were in-opportunity. We were nurturing them throughout the opportunity as well. And then they became a close-won deal.&quot;</p><div class="relative my-20 py-16 px-12 bg-gradient-to-br from-[#f5f5f5] via-white to-[#f5f5f5] rounded-2xl border-l-8 border-[#9a33df] shadow-2xl"><div class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl leading-[1.3] font-bold text-[#1a1a1a] italic mb-6">&quot;I want to influence 100% of opportunities.

We need to experiment, right?&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">Here&#x27;s what they&#x27;re running:</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">UserGems has been in the stack for a while, but they were using it in &quot;a very limited fashion&quot; for one-off signals like job changes or past champions. Now with 2.0, &quot;they&#x27;ve unlocked a whole new universe of possibilities by stacking signals on top of each other and not just looking at one signal individually and they are able to integrate into Gong and target ads on LinkedIn at a person-level.&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">6sense is a big part of the stack. They use workflows to automate account routing. &quot;If you meet X criteria you go into this ad program versus if your behavior is Y and you fall into an SMB, mid-market or ENT segment you go into the appropriate track of ad campaigns.&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">Aida&#x27;s head of digital just spoke at the 6sense Breakthrough conference in Vegas about their workflows because &quot;we were a beta customer. I push my team to do beta everything. So we&#x27;re usually the guinea pigs.&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">That doesn&#x27;t always work. &quot;It&#x27;s not always fun when it doesn&#x27;t work, but when it does work, I feel like we get ahead of the curve and ahead of the competition.&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">They also use 6sense sales intelligence with Slack alerts. &quot;My CMO and I have Slack alerts for two of our solution areas and seethe hottest accounts and behind their surge in importance,every day. It allows us to see the content and campaigns they are responding to, the events that trigger them to engage further, etc.</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">AI agents: They&#x27;re looking at Qualified to supplement the inbound BDR motion. &quot;Our BDRs time is more valuable than just a meeting with a sales rep. That&#x27;s not where they bring value. So why not have personalized emails with an AI agent, have a knowledge base to train it with that can probably answer questions better than I can and then have it directly with the calendar link schedule a meeting with the rep.&quot;</p><p class="text-[17px] leading-[1.8] text-[#333] mb-9">She&#x27;s honest about the tech debt problem. &quot;I think it&#x27;s much easier for new startups to have a really clean, fresh tech stack that&#x27;s a lot less complicated as they have a lot less tech debt. A 20+ year old company has to reinvest itself but with a much bigger customer base, we also have the advantage of delighting a large number of customers that already trust us.</p><div class="my-16 relative"><div class="h-[300px] w-full rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-xl"><img src="/techdebt.png" alt="Marketing Technology Stack" class="w-full h-full object-cover"/></div></div><div class="bg-[#f8f8f8] p-10 my-12 rounded-xl border-2 border-[#e5e5e5] shadow-lg"><h3 class="text-base uppercase tracking-[1.5px] text-[#9a33df] mb-4 font-bold">What this means for you:</h3><ul class="text-[17px] leading-[1.7] text-[#333] space-y-2 ml-6"><li>Beta everything if you can absorb the risk.

That&#x27;s where I thrive.
